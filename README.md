Assignment 1 - wormy

- [x] a) Change the name of the game  (which displays at the beginning) to be something new.
- [x] b) Change the colors that display at the beginning.
- [x] c) Use a grid with more cells.
- [x] d) Have multiple apples on the grid.  New apples will be generated as they are eaten.  
- [x] e) Allow the user(s) to control two worms using the arrow keys (for one worm) and four other keys (for the 
other worm). The keypad arrow keys will be used to move both worms in the same direction at the 
same time.  The keypad arrow key names are K_KP2, K_KP4,  K_KP6, and K_KP8.
- [x] f) Show the scores for each worm separately.   You can use whatever scoring system you like.   
- [] g) The worm dies when it hits a wall, the other worm, or itself.  The worm is left behind as a stone.  If a 
stone is hit by a worm, the worm dies.
- [ ] h) Implement some variation of this idea: Allow the worms to shoot each other.  If the worm is hit, it cuts 
him in pieces (based on where the ray hits him).  The tail is left behind as a stone.  If a stone is hit by 
either worm, the worm dies.
- [ ] i) For 6110 students: Add a third worm which is not controlled by the user but moves (somewhat) 
intelligently. 
- [ ] j) Bonus (2 points): Implement an additional feature of your choice.
